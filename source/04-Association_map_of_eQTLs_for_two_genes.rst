Association map of eQTLs for two genes
==========================

We apply the eQTLs shared by two genes to plot the gene association map and give the expression profile of each gene in different tissues.

Here, you can click the Readmore button below the Gene Association Expression Plot section on the home page to enter the interface.

Then, you can input the eGene and tGene in the corresponding box. And the examples of input are in parentheses. Optionally, you can choose to view the expression information about egene and tgene. Then click the submit button below to view the results. You would get expression profile of each gene in different tissues and association plot of common SNPs of two genes.
